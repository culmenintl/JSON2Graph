The term does not derive from the word \"brutal\", but originates from the French *béton brut*, or \"raw concrete\", a term used by [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier) to describe his choice of material. [British architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_United_Kingdom) critic [Reyner Banham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyner_Banham) adapted the term into \"brutalism\" (originally \"New Brutalism\") to identify the emerging style.\n\n&gt;Brutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients, with numerous examples in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil, the Philippines, and Australia. Examples are typically massive in character (even when not large), [fortress-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification), with a predominance of exposed [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete) construction, or in the case of the \"brick brutalists\" ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. Brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and [shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall) to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.\n\n&gt;In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. In one critical appraisal by Banham, Brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. \"Brutalism\" as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics; architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. More recently, \"brutalism\" has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular – as a synonym for \"brutal\" – making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/bk21nrm.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DHHS2_by_Matthew_Bisanz.JPG) - *Hubert H.

Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. Both times I had nothing blocking my view, but when I fired, I would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated I'd shot a wall. Wtf?\n* Severe server lag. I'm talking, dying to people after I've killed them. I also killed somebody with an EM6 after I had already died and switched loadouts to a GD7-F. Movement seems warpy, people moving extra fast. It feels as though the server is trying to \"catch up\" and suddenly moves the player models forward extra fast. \n* Been having the cloak glitch a lot. When infil, it gets stuck in this weird half-cloaked phase and I can't tell if I'm really cloaked or not. On HA, I occasionally get stuck glowing even when my shield is off.\n* Invisible people.

However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter. \n\nEventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper). \n\nMatches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties. \n\nUnlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final. The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley. \n\nLong post but there you go. The League Cup isn't taken as seriously by bigger teams (hence why Sunderland, Swansea, Bradford, Cardiff and Birmingham have been finalists in the last 4 years) but the FA Cup is always regarded as the best cup competition in the world due to its rich history.

I do feel I owe it to myself to try these and some other vendors, at the same time I feel like 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' and everything seems to be working well:)  I do enjoy seeing y'all recommending and promoting each other around these parts and hearing tell of your positive actions in the ecr and larger vaping community.

The biggest irritation to me was PLA leaking from the hotend, but a fan duct printed and installed that put airflow across the heat sink on the head fixed the issue.\n\nYou can see from most of the comments already that the theme with the TAZ is frustration yet in the end they're glad they went with it.  Once you do find the sweet spot though it's a beast of a printer that has no problems printing 24/7.  In fact Lulzbot prints 24/5 with over a hundred of them.  As /u/jebba said in another thread there's a new all metal hotend very close to production likely about the same time as their new mini printer.  I'm sure the TAZ 5 will have the improvements such as the self leveling system and new hotend.\n\nI can't say anything really bad about Makerbot's 2/2x.  They have their own issues but once you work on them a bit they're solid workhorses.  The 5th gens... stay away for now.\n\nMakerGear M2 is a really solid printer.  I know a few people who own them and if you look at 3dhub's guide the printer is very well liked.\n\nA printer I would highly suggest is an Ultimaker 2.  It has a smaller build volume than the TAZ but it's far less picky with settings.  It's my first choice when printing most of the time just because it works with minimal fuss and can print faster at the same quality levels.  With ninjaflex and composite ninjaflex/ABS parts the TAZ wins hands down though.\n\nIf you can accept the build volume the Flashforge Creator Pro is a nice choice and very well built.  Any part that has a higher potential failure rate is easy to replace and spares are on their site.  It doesn't hold your hand when it comes to documentation though.","subreddit":"3Dprinting","parent_id":"t3_2qxrrr","controversiality":0,"edited":1420070604,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rk5q","retrieved_on":1425124279,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":"","gilded":0,"author_flair_text":"Lulzbot TAZ 4, Ultimaker 2, Flashforge Creator Pro"},

If you parse in the latest extreme dungeons, WHM is consistently way higher dps than sch if both are being played optimally.  My runs have also finished minutes faster than compared with skilled SCH's in game.  If I wasn't at work I'd share some of the parses given to me by people running them during the tests; but I'm sure if you did the same tests you'd get similar numbers and times.  The best new dungeon to speed run is Qarn imho.  The worst being Snowcloak (due to constant forced stops).\n\nAnd while I'm not saying it's impossible, I never saw a group with SCH instead of WHM clear faster than 10-11 minutes in WP back then.

So, the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste, while the video card will be huffing and puffing, straining at the seams.\n\nDrop the CPU down to a non-overclock i5-4460 or 4590, and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X, and you'll be playing every modern-day game at a smooth 60 FPS on High/Ultra settings -- for nearly the same price. If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself, you'd be lucky if you got 30-40 FPS on High, and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 30-40 (which is a minimum, by any PC gaming standard). Of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates, but do you really want to limit yourself like that? Surely at some point you'll want a better monitor (they're only about $120-130 for a high-quality IPS LED), and your hardware won't be able to keep up with it.\n\nIf your intention is to play video games on this PC, you're making a big mistake. I urge you to heed my advice on how to allocate your resources for better overall performance.

These abilities on the enemy are in my opinion a great addition to the game. I've been running massive amounts of T4 missions recently because of how insanely fun it has become. However, this is also because I have high RoF weapons in my T4 load out. The nullifiers and eximi shields need to follow the rules placed onto player controlled Globes. This means, explosive munitions I.e. Penta nades, Ogris rockets or blast procs need to affect the enemies within the shield as they do on players. Or conversely players should finally be immune to procs coming from outside the globe and into it. \r\rAnother thing DE should consider is removing the damage limit on shields. Its pretty ridiculous how high RoF weapons are better against Nullifier shields (I've noticed this is only on Nullifiers) that slow high damage weapons. To put this into perspective, my Boltor Prime shoots spikes that deal ~800 damage to the nullifier shields. My opticor deals 8640 damage to the shields yet it always takes around a full opticor mag, 5 shots (~9 shots with multishot) to take the shield down. DE needs to remove the damage limit the shields can take from one damage source allowing the viability of both high RoF and slow RoF weapons to be viable.\r\rAn idea I've been tinkering with is to make the shields susceptible to weapon procs. Blast procs can CC enemies inside the shield while Magnetic procs can deal more damage to the shield itself. By introducing this mechanic, Void missions become more dynamic as players have to choose when and where to switch weapons.\r\r\rTL;DR 1) unify rules with regard to out of body shields. Players should be able to affect enemies in shield or be immune to them inside their own.\r\r2) Remove damage limit on shields to make slow RoF weapons viable against nullifiers.\r\r3) Add elemental weaknesses to the shields, bringing more variety to weapon elemental choices in the void.","distinguished":null,"id":"cnas9hy","archived":false,"score":2,"author":"kanmax92","subreddit":"Warframe","parent_id":"t3_2qvuwv","retrieved_on":1425124278,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2urg0","edited":false},

All the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control, but 5 additional cards, 5 turns when you're not taking fatigue, seems absolutely insane to me. Also, this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with Secrets and have Mad Scientist-esque effects into the game. I'd gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card, but I think against control it could be insanely useful.\n\nI think Shadow Summoner doesn't produce an insane amount of burn at all; you pay 9 mana just to get the first Shadow Bomber on board (6 for the card, 2 for hero power, 1 for the Bomber), and you can only Hero Power once per turn. If you have pressure to go along with it, then yes, it will do work, but on its own I don't think it's that strong at all.\n\nFor Tinkerer, I imagined this card less as a Jeeves (who simply allows any class to be zoo) and more like a mini-Gazlowe. I think if you even have two cards on board that generate Spare Parts (like a Gnome and Yeti) and you trade them in, this card gives you value. Two extra Spare Parts with Gazlowe or Antonidas or even Auctioneer is really good, and you're not paying too much to get them. \n\nBeastmaster can have synergy with Hunter cards obviously, allowing you to Houndmaster anything, enable Kill Command, etc. etc. This can let you do stuff like turn 4 Yeti turn 5 Beastmaster + Houndmaster, or turn 3 Harvest Golem turn 4 coin Beastmaster Houndmaster; basically it allows a work-around for there being a low number of good beasts in the game. It also synergizes with Druid of the Fang, I don't know if that's enough to make Beast Druid viable but I think it's worth considering. And, the most important part for me, it is a vastly superior Black Knight + Mark of the Wild with Hemet Nesingwary; a 6 mana Assassinate that also summons a 6/3 and a 2/1. \n\nGenerator is insane if you can get value from it, but you have to run the Paladin secrets in exchange, which are pretty mediocre. And they won't get amazing value with the board state, except for Avenge; Redemption will be bad if they kill the Generator, Noble Sacrifice won't be spectacular, and the other ones will be garbage as usual.\n\nI'll agree that Shadowy Archer is too strong; do you think making it a 1/2 would be fine (still better than Creeper, but it is a class card)?\n\nFor the Tortoise, it does seem limited, but I think in a deck with a lot of card draw, or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws, playing 2/2s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game. A comparison could be made with Hogger in terms of how 2/2 Taunts can snowball out of control. Also it's a Beast, though I don't know how useful that is.\n\nI didn't consider the Shade comparison with Fel Imp at all, I think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker, when making it I was thinking of the synergy with Floating Watcher; you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once. Also with Blood Imp on board he grows faster than Shade as well, although not by much. He's probably a much worse play in the early game, but I think when you can play him and a few health-buffing effects immediately he shines.\n\nFor Neighborhood Blacksmith, I think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons, but then you can't use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have. And if you only get a few more charges, then he's pretty comparable to Greenskin;  with 1 minion, he's just worse, with 2 it's arguable (+1/+1 on the weapon but -2 Attack), so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better Greenskin. Which for current Warrior decks isn't that easy to achieve.\n\nThanks again for the response!","link_id":"t3_2qq3wf","name":"t1_cnas9k3","score_hidden":false},

{"body":"I remember when I started picking up things in the Steam sale: Tomb Raider, Max Payne 3, Skyrim, The Witcher 2 Enhanced, all for under £5. Some were even £2.50 or something.\n\nNow I'm looking at half the AAA stuff (as above) sitting at £15+ and 'indie' titles like Shovel Knight for £7/8.

You can make tight rules with an unbalanced system, or a balanced system with not tight rules.\n\nIf it was about balance, well, warmachine/hordes is one system that supports 14 full factions, and warhammer 40k has 18 (really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions).  fantasy doesn't have to be balanced against 40k so it's not included.  So the difference isn't so great.  unless you think the jump from 14 to 16-18 factions really breaks the camels back there, but i cant see it.\n\n\n\n\nBut back to the tight ruleset -  warhammer 40k's main rules problem isn't the vast number of rules.  It's not the minute rules interactions.  Really the core problem is the rules aren't written in a systematic fashion.\n\nA systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system.\n\n40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time, and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing, leading to confusion.\n\n40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english.  Most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule, then they write it down in the confines of the rules set.\n\nTo use an example earlier today - \"a single passenger can fire out of each Fire Point\".  This is a poor rule as it stands, because the timing is not defined, and 40k doesn't even have a definition for what firing means.  do you \"Fire\" psychic shooting attacks?  Are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon?  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons?\n\nA tighter defined rules set would have defined \"fire\" as making a ranged attack, and ranged attacks as psychic, shooting, etc.  It would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is.\n\nTo use an example from a comprehensive ruleset, in magic there's a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana.  In 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads \"All blue lands produce an extra mana\".  \n\nThat would be a terrible rule.  produce is not defined, it doesn't say when they make the extra mana (when they produce, do they produce two?  do they produce one now and one at the normal time?).  Theres just a lot of problems with that wording, you know this without even playtesting it.\n\nThats why magic words it \"Until end of turn, whenever a player taps an Island for mana, that player adds Blue to his or her mana pool\"   The timing is defined, tap is a defined term in the rules, everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset.\n\nJust reading through different games' rulesets, you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned. 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend, not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from.  It's not the minor interactions that come from having so many rules, it's the way they are written.\n","created_utc":"1420070442","downs":0,"parent_id":"t1_cnapvp0","subreddit":"Warhammer40k","edited":1420071036,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rr81","controversiality":0,"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1425124274},

It's to get ahead of the driver plain and simple. \nThe typical argument I hear on Reddit is how we should just stay in the lane so people in cars don't get held up from us passing. \nFirst off, fuck anyone who says that. It's fucking selfish. \nIf I'm going 65mph on flat ground and another driver is going 64mph I'm going to go around him because I want to keep going 65 and not 64 just because people driving a car can't wait a minute while I pass someone. \nIf the guy I'm passing does 64mph 11 hours a day he will do 704 miles. If he does that 5 days a week for a whole year that's 183,000+ miles per year that he's doing. \nNow I come along doing 65mph. Which using the same math I cover 2,000 more miles a year than him. \n\nOn a typical day with my current outfit I make about $250 per day doing about 350 miles. So since I'm covering 11 more miles than him a day but I get stuck behind him doing 64 that means I'm losing $250 per month. \nNow he doesn't directly cause this loss of income because he's just trucking along minding his own business. But I'm losing money by going slower because I get less loads done per year going slower than I usually go. \nSo regardless if someone is approaching I'll swing around him, get back up to speed, pass him and then move back over. And then you can go by no problem. \nAdditionally, I don't want to stare at the back of a trailer I know I can pass. Anyone can agree with that. \n\nIf you made it this far then that's good. Haha\n\nA Truck driver is on the road for weeks at a time. We deal with every kind of driver. Some are kind and considerate. Some are giant dicks almost accidents. Most are inconsiderate pricks who think that their time is more precious than mine. \nWe're all out here trying to make money and get somewhere safe. \n\nThanks for reading. Be safe today.

I've played with it a little by scanning beers I know that I already know I like or dislike and and I think it does give make pretty damn good predictions once you've added enough reviews to your profile.\n\nIf you rate a beer/wine in their app, it won't tell you, \"If you liked this then you might like Beer X\" the way untappd does. It just stores that score data and uses it develop a profile for your likes and dislikes.\n\n\n\n\nTheir biggest shortcoming is that they actually have to have a sample of the beer/wine sent in for analysis to be able to rate it, so their database is lacking all but the more widely available and mainstream beers for the most part.

If someone online tells a sob story, I'll probably say something sympathetic just to be polite and I feel sorry for them just like I feel sorry for someone I read about in the news who's suffering, but I don't actually care like I would about someone I'm close with. INTJs take a while to warm up to someone, we tend not to have a lot of close friends. It sounds like you're expecting a high degree of emotional connection from someone who might just see you as an acquaintance or casual friend because he doesn't know you well enough yet.

You showed eaches reaction to her becoming upset at the idea of having blood, but their relationship itself wasn't talked about (if I'm remembering correctly). It always seemed to me that Adele wanted to push the responsibility of Olive onto Caden, yet when she leaves, she takes Olive with her. Almost as if she's enjoying the fruits of Olive's childhood, but leaving Caden to eat the rest. Further is the idea that Olive is in fact an extension of Caden, Adele can never escape Caden as long as Olive is with her, which to me comes back to the scene where Olive is afraid of the blood inside her. Caden tries to tell her that yes, she has blood (he wants to feel a bit of himself is in Olive), but Adele tells Olive that she doesn't have blood (saying Caden is not in Olive) which allows her to escape from Caden, with Olive, and not feel like, or able to deny, that Caden's work still lingers in the form of Olive.","created_utc":"1420070460","downs":0,"author":"Nezzatic","score":2,"archived":false,"distinguished":null,"id":"cnas9xx"},

It could present a way to stop people from making absurd numbers of alt accounts and farming achievements, that was the issue with that event wasn't it?  If they played the event out just as before, but with a minimum Steam Level to trade the relevant items (low enough to be widely accessible, high enough that you have to have had Steam for at least a little while), I think it would nip those issues in the bud.\n\nI don't mind the cards so much because it's essentially free money to me, I've saved quite a bit of extra dosh over the course of this sale, and appreciate a handful of change off most of the games I buy.  The gems on the other hand, I don't really see them as useful or exciting to anyone except those who have invested extremely heavily in Steam trading.  If you run the conversion rates it's almost always advantageous to sell your cards to Russian money launderers instead.\n\nI hope they get around to doing something different with the sale items you get too.  As it is they're very lackluster, being essentially a sub-par Steam sale you can use off-season.

Please forgive me. I made up my own warning message.\n\n\nJake awoke to the rumbling sound of helicopters flying low over his house. Sitting up slightly and squinting through the haze of sleep, he looked at the clock on his nightstand. Instead of the glowing red numbers, there was only darkness. Then he checked his watch.\n\n3:54 AM.\n \nWith a sigh he dropped back onto his pillow causing his wife to stir and mutter something unintelligible. Just then a searchlight swept across his yard illuminating his bedroom windows before moving on.\n\n“Fucking Mondays.” He said aloud. Beside him his wife continued to sleep soundly despite the continuing noise. He rolled over and put an arm around her, smiling as he snuggled close to her warmth, envying her ability to sleep through anything. \n\nThen, over the drone of rotor blades, an announcement sounded in an amplified voice. “A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered to exit your homes, remain on your front lawn and await further orders.” The message began to repeat.\nWhat? He thought, utterly confused. Everyone has to go outside? What’s going on? Begrudgingly he arose and walked to the window as a spotlight swept his house again. Down the street he could see several military vehicles as well as a few patrol cars with red and blue lights flashing. Several of his neighbors were already on their lawns looking sleepy and bewildered in their nightclothes. Then he noticed what looked like a greyhound bus being loaded. “What the?”\n\n“What is it honey?” Sue asked having finally awoken and sat up.\n\n“I don’t know. The police and the military are down the street and they are ordering everyone outside. It looks like they are loading people onto a bus.”\n\n“The military? A bus?” She sounded incredulous. Then she heard the announcement amidst the cacophony. \n\n“A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered…” it continued. \n\n“They’re coming up the street!” Jake said. “They just kicked in Rob Merkele’s door!” His pulse quickened.\n\n“They’re doing what?” Sue asked, still not fully awake.\n\n“They’re dragging his family outside!” \n\n“Who? The police?”\n\n“The military!” He turned from the window to face Sue. “Fuck this. I don’t know what’s going on but I don’t like it.”\n\n“What are we going to do?” She asked.\n\nHe pulled the blinds back again but didn’t answer. The windows were shaking from the helicopters. “They just kicked the Hampton’s door in!”\n\nBy now Sue had gotten out of bed and was standing beside Jake looking out of the window.\n\n“Get the kids up and get them in here.” He said.\n\n“Right.” Said Sue and ran from the room and down the hall, turning lights on as she went.\n\nTwo more houses and they would be here. What to do? What to do? He thought about hiding places within the house. The attic. The back of a closet. The trunk of their car. Nothing was right. Should he just go along with this?\n\nSue came back with their two children Tom, 5, and Emily who was 7. They were on their feet but still mostly asleep. \n\n“Go grab a bunch of their clothes and any medicines they may need. We’ve only got a few minutes. They are almost here.” \n\n“What to do? What to do?” He kept asking himself aloud. Must he go along with whatever this was? How could they get away? Scanning his memory of the area, he remembered a drainage ditch beyond his property in the back yard that ran into a large tunnel. It was a chance.\n\nJake ran out of the room to find his wife. “Sue? Sue?”\n\n“Yes?” The sound came from Emily’s room. \n\n“Sue! Quick, get them dressed as best you can and shoes on their feet, we are going to try to get out by the drainage tunnel behind the house.”\n\n“The drainage tunnel? Is that safe?” She asked.\n\n“It’s our only chance.”\n\nShe was still doubtful. “We don’t even know what’s going on. They may shoot us if we run. And if we do get away what then?”\n\nIt was obvious how scared she was as she was standing there in her nightgown, bundles of clothes in her arms.\n\nThere was a hard knocking at the front door. They both jumped at the sound. “Open up! Open the door!” Pound! Pound! Pound! There were several voices. “Everybody on the street now! Open up. Open the door or we will break it down!” Pound! Pound! Pound!\n\nThe look in her eyes as she shook her head no told him all he needed to know. She wouldn’t be running anywhere with the kids. For a moment they just stood there looking at each other in the midst of the chaos. Pound! Pound! Pound!\n\n“Ok.” He said, and walked to open the front door.\n\nThere was a large crash as the door busted open. The cops or military men, he couldn’t tell, streamed inside. They were dressed in all black and their weapons were at the ready. \n\n“Police! Police!” they yelled as they progressed through the house. They came upon his family huddled on the bed in Jake and Sue’s bedroom.  “Everybody on the floor! Everybody down! Get on the floor!”\n\nJake was in front of his family, his arms spread wide covering as much of them as he could.\n\n“On the fucking ground now!” The point man yelled. His weapon was pointed at Jake’s head where a red dot now bounced and jiggled. “Do it now! Do it now!”\n\nJakes heart sank. He was powerless. Here were a bunch of armed men threatening his family and all he could do was shield them with his body. Both of their children were sobbing as his wife held them.\n\n“On. The. Fucking. Ground. Now!” The point man shouted. The other men behind him were now coming in and shouting orders and pointing their weapons. The point man grabbed Jake’s wrist and yanked him off of the bed, throwing him to the ground and putting a knee in his back. The second man in grabbed his wife’s wrist pulling her to the ground causing her to scream.\n\n“Hey!” Jake shouted, pulling his head as far off of the ground as he could trying to see. “Stop hurting my wife!” His arm was grabbed, twisted behind his back and a handcuff was snapped around his wrist.\n\n“Stop resisting!” the man on top of Jake yelled.\n\nA third man came into the room, grabbed his daughter and threw her to the floor. She yelled as he did so and began crying loudly.\n\n“Stop you motherfuckers!” Jake yelled. \n\nThe person on top of him put an elbow into his face. “Shut up and stop resisting!” He twisted the other hand around his back preparing to cuff him. Spurred on by the cries of his family and without thinking, he tried to roll over but had no leverage. This prompted another elbow to the face. He tried throw the guy again. This time his left leg found purchase against the nightstand and he pushed. \n\nUnder normal circumstances there would be little chance of anyone bucking a trained fully grown man off of their back, but this was a father protecting his family. A split second of superhuman strength was all that was needed to send him flying against the dresser. Flailing, the cop or whoever grabbed at a partially open drawer as he fell and brought the dresser down on top of himself. Jake, now on his feet, barely avoided the falling dresser as he lunged for the person on top of his wife at the foot of the bed.\n\nHe had his knee in the back of her neck and was preparing to cuff her when they made contact. Both went rolling. Jake ended up on the bottom. The man threw several punches and landed a few on Jake’s face, then paused and reached behind himself. Jake took a swing at the man’s face but his fist missed. The free end of the half fastened handcuff did not. It struck the man squarely in the cheekbone, making solid contact enough to break the bone and send blood pouring from his nose and cut onto Jake. That sent the man’s hands to his face as he let out what would have been, if not for the circumstances, a comically effeminate scream. Jake did not notice. All he knew was that the man was no longer trying to fight. Another swing and the handcuffs connected with his temple silencing him.\n\nJake struggled to his knees, pushing the man off of him and got to his feet. The other person clearing the house, hearing the struggle, now made his way down the hall and into the room. Seeing his one comrade holding his blood covered face and the other struggling to get a dresser off of him, he went into kill mode. He raised his weapon and pulled the trigger as Jake came at him. The sound was instant and sharp, quickly reducing the noise of his kids crying, the helicopters outside, everything, to a high pitched ring.\n\nJake did not feel the bullet pierce his midsection right below the sternum, was not aware of the .223 round’s tumble as it ripped through flesh and guts, spilling bile and blood where it should not go. Jake was only aware of the man in front of him at as his momentum carried them both to the floor. This time Jake was on top. Rage consumed him. Viciously he punched the man, trying to destroy him, his very existence. Over and over his fist made contact with the man’s face, nose, mouth. Teeth cut his knuckles which began to bleed. Blood splattered everywhere.","created_utc":"1420070464","downs":0,"score":1,"author":"BuggerSandwich","id":"cnas9zy","distinguished":null,"archived":false,"score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_cnas9zy","link_id":"t3_2qwwye"},

A family of a deceased business owner approached me and asked me to buy the business for what seemed to be a cheap rate.  I figured it had enough revenue to cover the purchase cost and some goodwill from being so old (founded in 1985) and the customer list and registration to do business with the government.\n\nThe company served the clients mentioned - mainly selling blank video tapes for security cameras.  That's pretty much what the business did.  One of the Atlantic Financial employees had plans to make it into more of a broad consulting company but we didn't.   \n\nThe company continued those services for a couple years as the contracts wound down and never worked in those areas again.  We considered pursuing some government business but didn't.  The company never asked for or got any new government contracts and the one part time employee who was on board with the aquisition moved on -- the internal employee working on it moved on.   The small amount of revenue that came in covered most of the costs of the purchase.  \n\nI had thought that the business might have had value since it is a service disabled veteran business and I'm a disabled vet -- but I never used that certification or pursued those lines of business.  It's really not my cup of tea.  I had also considered using the business as a vehicle to help out a freind who is a martial arts trainer who had trained military and police - so he could run contracts through the business since it was registered in all the databases needed to do business with the government but it was too much effort relative to the reward.\n\nWe scrapped all the inventory, delisted all contracts with all government agencies and turned the shell of what was left into basically a catch all for web development and domain names we are afflicted with.   The company took on a couple small web consulting clients in later years.\n\nAt the time -- 2004 or so, I was not as adamantly against the government as I am now.  I had some interest in some types of government contracts -- I didn't pursue them but some of the work such as USAID efforts in Pakistan and security work interested me.  I didn't pursue it, it doesn't interest me now and I don't do any government work now.   Even the tiny bit of work that this company, which was owned by my company did was not something I was personally active in or profited from.\n\nI am only giving so much information for full disclosure.   That client list is pretty similar for Google, Microsoft, Dell etc Etc.   The government buys a lot of stuff.   I don't like it, I don't prefer working woth government and I wish they were smaller.\n","subreddit":"Bitcoin","parent_id":"t1_cnar3h5","controversiality":0,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s3qj","retrieved_on":1425124268,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0},

The extra walls came after the additions to my previous base design.

The walls by my TH are aesthetic but the other serve WB purposes and the one in the middle was just to push them around into the bombs. My spring traps have launched more giants than my defenses have killed. The big bomb? Idk... I had extra wall pieces there like next to my cc but WB's haven't been a problem at all. Mass giants or mass archers have been the biggest threat. They drop em to take out that AD knowing they'll also take a crack at that vital \"exposed\" wall piece. After the AD is gone they throw out a healer which my balloons and archers dispose of. \n\nI like finally getting to discuss my base with someone! Keep the suggestions and advice coming. If I pushed my ad behind walls say where the BB is, any advice for the BB? I've tried many layout edits to fit it in the middle but was never happy.

Running lean is a vague term. You have a temperature peak around the stœchiometric of the fuel. The peak begins before lambda and ends after lambda. The danger here is that running a tad bit leaner than lambda will increase combustion temperature. If you continue to lean, there will not be enough fuel to produce heat thus the peak goes down. \n\nWhat I am saying is that it is difficult without proper engine monitoring to determine if you are passed the heat peak or not. CHT temp is critical IMHO. because the head gets less oil and is only cooled by air, the only other way to keep it cool is to run richer. The unburnt fuel will drop the combustion temperature at the cost of producing more undesirable by-byproduct. \n\nThe only fuel that I know that will burn hotter when richer is the Diesel and alike (jet fuel and such).

Is it just a coincidence its where Reddit is based, \n\nNot entirely sure what youre asking so this might not be the answer youre looking for: Essentially it is just a coincidence, A858 has various timezones it uses, one of those happens to fall in line with Massachusetts. The important factor is its controlled by the bot itself and likely has absolutely no relation to where the bot is located in real life.\n\n&gt; how the reason why nothing has been solved yet is because there is nothing to solve\n\nPlenty of things have been solved, take a look at this list: \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/posts\n\nSome of them are not yet completely solved however eventually they will be. It is clear that the owner of the bot is aware that we are solving these codes and are specifically putting out puzzles - hence why theres no way its used to test reddit. \n\nIf youre wondering why the bulk of it isnt being solved is because its not yet possible. There are clues in the easier puzzels which give information on how to solve the main bulk. The working theory is those messsages you see being posted constantly are actually part of groups and are more than likely encrypted. There is no way of outright breaking the encryption (or incredibly low chance) so we rely on solving the other puzzels to even be able to think about trying to solve those. \n\n&gt;there might just be a certain pattern to the random strings generated (e.g on letters a-f are included)?\n\nThe pattern you are seeing is HEX encoding. Essentially hex is any 0-9 A-F (Where A = 10 and F = 16).

{"body":"Absolutely liquidate. Our bank's PB is not in the business of taking a hit/loss because we let a client blow through their margin. This is the response to the asset declining significantly in value, not necessarily the same thing as \"rates rising\".  There is also no guarantee a firm will pay its obligations on the debt (especially on jr unsecured or other lower priority tranches). In the event of catastrophic failure of a credit portfolio, the hedge fund can declare bankruptcy, wipe their hands clean, and owe us nothing beyond the liquidation value of the fund (and at 5x leverage, \"catastrophic\", where we could potentially incur a loss, would be a 20% hit in equity of the portfolio). Any deficit between that and the margin they posted would be our bank's loss.  Likewise, if they were to walk away from a negative margin equity portfolio, it could potentially take days (or weeks) to liquidate positions of a hedge funds size.  During this time, the liquidation could accelerate the market to move against the assets thus forcing greater losses on the bank.\n\nThis is why liquidity considerations are part of the margining methodology. In stocks we look at multiples of 100x avg daily trade volume. With credit we're concerned with % of outstanding issuance as well as # of available executable pricing sources (from appropriately sized dealers) and frequency of those broker quotes. \n\nThis generalizes your question though. Credit portfolios don't inherently suffer when rates rise. There are plenty of floored and variable coupon and step coupon corp bonds out there that are intrinsically lower duration.

It's to stop people who can't afford to consume the legal vodka from purchasing illicit supplies.\n\nThe government in the past decade has been increasing taxes on it and implementing stricter rules. It's reduced consumption and deaths by a third so far. However the downside to this is that illicit vodka is becoming more common for those who can't afford the prices.\n\nThis has been a problem for some time now.\n\nhttp://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/07/17/russias-vodka-tax-backfiring/\n&gt; As many experts – and drinkers – warned from the start, high taxes on alcohol have driven hard-drinking Russians to seek out cheaper, illegal sources of booze. Vodka makers complain that they can no longer compete with a thriving black market offering cut price liquor and moonshine.\n\nhttp://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/21-11-2012/122882-vodka-0/\n&gt; According to official figures, the volume of vodka sold on the Russian market doubles the amount of produced vodka. In 2011, the statistical difference was 40 percent. Factory counterfeit products, produced in the \"fourth shift\", are available in all cities of Russia and take about one-third of the market - one billion bottles.\n\n\nIt's right for the government to take action on Vodka consumption and illicit production. Russia has sorted it's self out from being the demographic basketcase it was, however there are still to many Russians dying unnecessarily. Unless they can stop police and officials from turning a blind eye on the illicit production, raising taxes won't do much. \n\nThey need to take a more long term approach. The way the UK does when it comes to stopping drinking and driving and smoking. Hard hitting ads, NGOs and youth groups that spread awareness, large alcohol free zones that makes drinking inconvenient and etc.\n\nAt this point it's a societal issue and not something that can be solved by higher taxes.","link_id":"t3_2qxs48","name":"t1_cnasahp","score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4j","edited":false,"ups":6,"retrieved_on":1425124263,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"subreddit":"europe","parent_id":"t3_2qxs48"},

In the comics, Daisy, Black Widow and Fury are the only agents with level 10 clearance, or something to that affect. Daisy is *fiercely* loyal to Shield, so we know she would never betray the good guys, and that's all good and great! I have a feeling on the other hand, this subreddit is trying to hard to introduce Ward as the epitome of evil in the show. And for Ward to be so blinded by an obsession that he thinks is true love could make him the true threat of a season or two is too easy for the writers, not to mention in my mind, is somewhat unrealistic. If Wards thinks his true feelings of love for Skye are real, then all those moments where we see him improve when Skye is around and redeem himself do not point in the direction of someone descending into a fit of madness and the desire to murder. It makes Wards character childish, and I don't believe that's what Ward really is. Personally, I think that now that Skye has shot Ward, and proven that his endeavours to win back Skye are fruitless, he will simply leave from her life in silence. Over the rest of the season, with Agent 33 by his side, I think he will be realistic with himself and try to rid her from his mind as best he can, though that's not to say I think we will succeed. I believe he will always have feelings for skye, but he will just be able to control and understand them better.\n\nTL;DR Ward won't be a \"Super Villain\", he will finally try to give Skye some distance and God knows where that will take him","created_utc":"1420070510","downs":0},

However I'm pretty sure those require a conviction.   Though frankly, as the law sits,  they're not a rapist if not found guilty.   \n\nThe problems with custody and child support involving \"rape\" where the offender is granted parental rights of support or custody,  isn't actual rape but statutory rape,  these cases are under a slightly different color of law,  as the offender and victim are not necessarily risk laden when it comes to the welfare of the child.  Even though if convicted they'd likely dissolve any parental rights anyhow.   Ultimately this particular matter isn't one of regular concern,  or even of minor concern.   At very worst,  the rape victim will have to fight the custody in court, which can be a pain in the ass,  plus a traumatic bit considering their rapist is the plaintiff.   But to be actually awarded custody for their efforts,  I'm not sure a case as such even exists in the US (statutory rape excluded) and if it does, it's exceedingly rare.  "},

All extremely helpful and provides quite an interesting contrast with previous comments. I find my self to love to experiment and dabble in different ways of making films and recording folley and doing all sort of different thing that elevate my films above others in my same age group/department just because I mean, I never really say this out loud because it is awfully rude, but when I see films that have bad audio mixing, sound in general, or visual elements, I just die on the inside but learn from it at the same time and try to help everyone. And i do find it quite true that film is all a game of learning from previous mistakes because it is very difficult to learn from theory as opposed to actually getting out and doing it.

I watched GW2's development very closely and then I had a lot of fun playing it.\n\nBut as time goes on and the game stagnates, it starts to feel like wasted potential. The base for an amazing game is there, but it doesn't grow, it doesn't evolve, which not only is to be expected of an MMO, but is somewhat in contradiction with the original manifesto.\n\nMore than anything, it is disconcerting to me to see the franchise fade away due to neglect.

It depends on what you plan on doing, what works for your budget, if you actually plan on moving it places etc. For example, you may want a more expensive Singer but ask yourself if you really plan on using *all* the stitches.  If meh, then go with something else. It's not really \"what's better\" but what you plan on actually using it for. Why bother spending extra cash if you aren't going to use all the settings?\n\nIf your looking for \"Rolls Royce\" and don't care whether your going to use it for it's full potential, then go with Bernina or Viking. I have a Bernina for the weird stitches, far out quilting, appliques and it stays put. The Singer I have is a low-end 120.00 model which I actually love.

{"body":"&gt;Do you believe that social equity is particularly lacking in video games, as opposed to other forms of media and/or art? If so, in what ways?\n\nI think that video games as a whole, when you count mobile and indie games, is incredibly diverse. The areas where they are lacking are generally those with large budgets since developers tend appeal to the largest groups. It's not really any different from television and movies in that respect. The main difference is that the demographics in video games are much more young/male than movies so the video games which get made will reflect that.\n\n&gt;Do you believe that video games are a medium via which social values should be progressed? If so, how so? If not, why not?\n\nYes. I definitely think games can carry and deliver social values. And not only that, these games already exist. Many tend to be critiques of video games and video game culture rather than society at large. (See [AVGM](http://edmundmcmillen.blogspot.com/2009/02/avgm-retrospective.html), [Cow Clicker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_Clicker), [Spec Ops: The Line](http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/14/3590430/dont-be-a-hero-the-full-story-behind-spec-ops-the-line), etc). As more people get on board with the idea and start buying such games more such games will be made.\n\n&gt; What is your opinion of the presence of social equity in video games over the lifetime of video gaming? Have things gotten better or worse, and what games or characters make you feel this?\n\nThe stories have gotten better and the characters are more interesting than before.

Society still has an idea of what is masculine and what is feminine and it likes its men and women to conform to those.  \n\nI'm sure you wouldn't want to be told that you have a manly voice or that you are very hairy, but these are things that a man would probably like for himself. If I said you had a manly face, I'm guessing you wouldn't be too pleased (maybe you would, I don't know you) but if someone told me that, I'd be giddy. The phrase \"you throw like a girl\" is misleading (at least as far as I interpret it). On the surface it seems like it means that girls cannot throw, but it is more akin to \"you don't throw like a boy.\"  \n  \n\nI don't know that I can answer the last part. Personally, I don't see why women doing things makes them no longer manly, but I'll do my best to explain what I think it is.  \n\nAs far as I can tell, it is something to do with it no longer being masculine. If anyone can do it, how is it masculine? So when a man wants to assert his masculinity, he has to look for something else. The more women start doing traditional men things, the harder it is to find something manly.  \n\nIt's all very silly, but things like this always are.

It's not as much of an excuse as it is a ruing of what we the people have allowed to happen to our kids.\n\nI have a friend that went to school in the late 80ies and he was told by his school aid counselors that he had no access to work study or grants and had to take loans to finish his degree.  He was clueless what the consequences were as he'd never even had a credit card to that point.\n\nAs it turned out, the very counselors tasked with helping him were found to have taken kick back by the loan corporations and they lied to him about the grants.  He should have been given approximately 85% grants and would be facing a fraction of the debt he ended up with.\n\nThis is what we are doing to our kids, opening up the door to literal financial predators.  Our kids, our children. \n\nYour lack of empathy makes me sad but I am guessing you are just not very learned on what is taking place.","id":"cnasb99","distinguished":null,"archived":false,"score":2,"author":"garyp714","score_hidden":false,"link_id":"t3_2qxsxg","name":"t1_cnasb99","retrieved_on":1425124253,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"controversiality":0,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzg","subreddit":"business","parent_id":"t1_cnap7qd"},

I can't fault you your opinion, and I see where you're coming from, but IMO an equally primary attribute of the Bulldog according to its description is its stoutness and durability, which the name reflects quite well.\n\nThere already being a weapon named the Bulldog is a legitimate point, which makes me wonder why it's not much more than an afterthought in the OP. That said, it's not as if it's not something that happens in real life (for example: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bulldog), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog)).\n\nIDK, overall I like the name.

It doesn't have a several thousand year history, like Atheism. It came into existence here on the internet, and those screenshots include endorsed contributers. Make all the excuses you want, what the redpill is actually about is very very obvious.\n\nThe redpill is an excuse to shift the blame for romantic failures from the redpillers to the women they failed to attract, by turning women into the enemy. It tells boys that it's not *their* fault, it's the fault of the woman who are inherently out to get men and who only care about their status and the contents of their wallets. Then it feeds them a bunch of lies and pseudoscience and rehashed conservative values (women cheat! women want older men! women won't respect you! women are only valuable while young and naive!) while totally failing to tell them what healthy relationships are like. \n\nEven the core idea is a cognitive dissonance: Women occupy all of their mental real estate and they twist and contort themselves to get their attention, engaging in elaborate plots and acting out scripts and making pretty much their entire life about \"bettering\" themselves so that women will want them. Then they claim that they have found a revelation about how not to be controlled by women. Yeah right. Making yourself into a guard doesn't get you out of jail, it just makes you the slave of the inmates because now everything you do is about keeping them in. \n\nIt's a toxic outlook that dooms anyone who follows it to a lonely future of hostile and antagonistic relationships while causing massive amounts of incidental harm to the women they date and any children unfortunate enough to be born to them. \n\nIt doesn't even work to pick up women. Anyone who approaches lots of women will eventually find one who is willing to stick around. Fools attribute their \"success\" to the redpill when really it's just that even horrible people with no redeeming qualities can get a SO. The world is full of examples, which they ignore. And when they do get into a relationship, it's generally with someone horrible, because they are looking for the stupid superficial things the redpill told them to look for, and ignoring red flags left right and center. Self fulfilling prophecy - if you expect women to be evil and materialistic and manipulative you don't blink when you find one that acts that way - and she *will* date you because she's used to men running for the hills when they figure out what she is. \n\nSo yeah, have fun defending the redpill. Be another sucker who falls for something cooked up by people who hate women as an excuse to hate women more, and let them keep ruining your life.

I also need a very rounded bottom cup. I have found that bras from the Eveden brands (Freya, Fantasie, Fauve, Elomi, Goddess) tend to have a more rounded bottom than Panache. \n\nI would thus encourage you to try more Elomi bras. Fauve in 36GG too if you can get your hands on them. Fantasie is made for a more even shape, Freya will most likely be too narrow and demand more volume on top than you currently have. \n\nBravissimo also has that rounded bottom in the majority of their bras, thus my recommendation for them. \n\nAs for Cleos - try them in your correct size or it will be difficult to judge fit. In a too wide band it is hard to swoop and scoop correctly. \n\nYou could probably get Cleo Lucy to fit you if you tried it in 34H/HH and altered the gore. It is possible to sew the gore narrower and in many cases this changes the fit of the Lucy from \"horrible\" to \"best bra ever\".\n\nAdditionally your breasts will change over the next year or so. They will become more even and you will need less volume in the bottom and more volume on top. Their basic shape will not change, but you will have an easier time fitting into bras that were a total desaster before.

I still value my personal life and my girlfriend as well as my school work over Magic but at this point in my life I'm lucky enough to not have to worry about paying bills and maintaining a home or anything like that thanks to dorm life. I'm sure things will change in the future but right now I'm young and I want to travel and I want to play Magic most of all.

Why did you choose Android or iOS? \n\nBack in 2010, when I was looking to upgrade from my Blackberry, I wanted a smartphone, but iPhone was only on AT&amp;T, a carrier with which I had had horrible experiences with.    But Verizon was showing off this neat \"Droid\" Incredible phone.   I got it, it worked great, from what I could see, it was as good as an iPhone with few gaps.   It even had built-in voice turn-by-turn navigation, something that iOS wouldn't have for years.  \n\nSince then, I've just continued to use Android mostly because I *really* use all the Android features, things like NFC, Google Wallet, automation with Tasker, swipe typing, etc. so going to iOS would always seem like a downgrade.   I simply am not willing to lose function I've come to depend upon.    I will say that iOS has done a good job in catching up, particularly with iOS 8,  but there are still things that are lacking.  \n\nI'll also caveat this by saying that I do use an iPad for work and I do think that iOS has done tablets pretty well, better than Android mostly because I don't tend to use all those advanced functions when using a tablet.     But the first thing I did on the iPad was to sweep all the Apple stuff into a folder and populate my home screen with Google stuff instead.   I'm deeply invested in the Googleverse, so having Google be a first class player on any device is important to me. \n\n       2. What are some things you envy about the opposite platform?\n\nI like the way that iMessage works smoothly.   I'd really like for Hangouts to get to that level.   I'd also like for Google Music to offer the breadth of music you can find on iTunes.   Also, as I said before, I'd like for Android's tablets to be better.   I think they came very close with the Nexus 7.   I like mine (a 2012 3G model that so far is still waiting for Lollipop).   But it is sluggish now.   Very different from my iPad.    Finally, I'd like Google to enforce a little more uniformity in its hardware so that we can see a better 3rd party market for things like mounts, cases, etc.  \n\n\n       3. What can you do on your platform that is easier or does not exist on the opposite platform?\n\nGoogle Now voice integration and Moto X's features like the wave to see notifications/time and hands free \"OK Moto\" search are great.   So is 4K video capture.    But I still go back to the basics:   Google's intents system is so advanced compared to iOS' nascient extensions.    To see what I mean, use Google Now to say \"Play music by Trans Siberian Orchestra\".    When Google responds, you can just let it play with the default player (Google Music on my phone) *or* you can choose *another* music player that's on your phone, like tuneIn radio,  Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, etc.   You simply cannot do that on iOS and it drives me crazy, especially since I generally use cloud-based music all the time, either Spotify or Google Music.   So if I tell  \"Play Trans Siberian Orchestra\"  to Siri, it whines about the fact that I don't have their music on my device instead of maybe bringing up Spotify.  \n\nThat plus automation.   I love that you can use things like Tasker to do crazy things like push programmable actions from your phone to Chromecast or automate certain settings based on time of day, location, or wifi network name. \n","created_utc":"1420070586","downs":0,"parent_id":"t3_2qy0ld","subreddit":"Android","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qlqh","edited":1420210682,"author_flair_css_class":"userDarkPink","author_flair_text":"Motorola Moto X(2014), T-Mobile, Stock","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1425124244,"ups":1},

The immediate effects on my clarity, focus, and mental energy were moderate, but noticeable, very similar to taking a blood-brain barrier crossing choline supplement like Alpha-GPC. This is due to the tams (and noopept) doing basically the same thing as a choline supplement (increasing choline in your brain), just in a different way; dosing choline will give it to you semi-immediately, after it is absorbed into your blood and passes the b-b barrier, while the tams increase your natural choline production temporarily. There are, of course, many differences in brain chemistry between people (namely their cholinergic systems), with different rate-limiters and impacts based on presence of other chemicals. Whenever I test a new chemical, I look for the following things in order:\n\n1) Research indicating long term positive effects. Because it's extremely difficult to self-measures over long periods, this is really your only option.\n\n2) Test a small dosage at the lower range and look for any immediate effects, positive or negative. Note all of them.\n\n3) Continuing testing with increasing dosages if test 2 was, at the very least, not negative. Continue doing so until a reasonable upper limit on intake is reached (based on research and your own experience with similar chemicals). If there's any negative effects, evaluate if using the substance is worth having that side effect.\n\nIf there's no research to indicate long term effects and no immediate benefit at upper intake levels, it's probably a dud for you and you should move onto better things, and not waste your money. If there's an immediate positive effect, take it as long as you feel safe and have the money to do so. If there's a long term positive benefit but no immediate effect, weigh the long term effect against the long term effects of other potential nootropics you can purchase with the same money, and purchase as many long term supplements as your budget will allow.\n\nHah, I wrote a lot of words tangentially related to your post.

He was the worst thing about the Frozen season IMO, even though I don't hate him in the movie and the actor did a great job.\n\nI just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again.  It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king.\n\n&gt; yet the OUAT fandom liked more Elsa, deeming that Anna was too goofy at times.\n\nI didn't get that at all.  I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc.\n\n&gt; Perhaps, In the end I just hope they don't drown us on this kind of stuff, more Frozen is good but becoming like the SW AU that no one but the most hardcore could follow due the extensive material there was would be overwhelming.\n\nI could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon.  The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.","archived":false,"distinguished":null,"id":"cnasc0u","author":"ArendelleKnight","score":2,"score_hidden":false,"link_id":"t3_2qwwwa","name":"t1_cnasc0u"},

Root actually said something to the effect that she's bored and disappointed in people and wants to set the Machine free in her first (or maybe second) episode as Root. And I believed her. But that didn't mean she wasn't a danger to the team.\n\nI'm surprised though that it's annoying/disturbing for some people (I've seen some comments like that before too) that Root calls the Machine “she”. My take is that it would be strange if Root called the Machine “it”. I would guess that people who are annoyed by the “she” maybe don't like Root's character that much in the first place, because calling the Machine “she” is very much in line with Root's development and motivations. \n\nRoot has allowed herself to be molded (and in some ways healed) by the Machine and she has made it obvious that not only is she willing to die for the Machine but she pretty much experts that that'll happen, Root has insisted the Machine cares etc. So if Root would call the Machine an “it” that would be like saying Root would knowingly revise her principles and sacrifice herself for a can of chicken soup and the chicken soup would appreciate it. People might compromise or risk whatever for gold or food etc, but then it's about greed or survival and that's not the deal with Root and the Machine.","downs":0,"created_utc":"1420070600","score":1,"author":"eikeegimuu","archived":false,"distinguished":null,"id":"cnasc4x"},

Our district does not currently have a program of this exact nature although one of the high schools has an engineering program that does some lego robotics stuff. Our goal is an overview of electronics, training on arduinos, and some more or less structured curriculum for year 1, plus a project-based workshop class for year 2. \n3. Various reports, usually.  We need to account for all the money spent.  We need to address the promises we made in the grant: we will measure scores on state assessments before and after, gpa, attendance, etc., anything we claimed we would measure in the proposal.  Some larger grants require attendance at a conference to present results and the travel for this conference must be explicitly budgeted. We are also promising to deliver the curriculum for 2 classes and a curriculum writing tool based on a relational database connecting the NGSS, the CCSS, and our activities and to make the tool available to other schools for use.

{"body":"The only way any college team would even have a prayer is if we are going with historical best/worst teams.\n\nSo... how about the [2001 Miami Hurricanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Miami_Hurricanes_football_team#Starting_lineup) VS the [2000 San Diego Chargers](http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/san-diego-chargers/roster/2000?sort=pos). I would have picked the only 0-16 team, the 2008 Lions, but I feel like all they'd need to do is air it up to Megatron against a college team and they'd be putting points up.\n\nThis Chargers team? They've got Seau and Rodney Harrison on D and as far as I can tell everyone else on the roster is either unknown or known to be terrible. I feel like the Canes would at least have a chance with... Clinton Portis, Jeremy Shockey, Andre Johnson, Najeh Davenport and 4 offensive lineman that went on to play in the NFL(with the other starter having a career in the CFL). On Defense, every single starter except for 1 went on to play in the NFL, most of them being high draft picks.\n\nIf we could time travel these 2 teams to the Rose Bowl to play against each other with, say 2 weeks to prepare for the game... I really think it's at least a 50/50 shot for Miami to wint, if not in their favor.","created_utc":"1420070616","downs":0,"author":"mrsammercer","score":0,"distinguished":null,"id":"cnascdm","archived":false,"score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_cnascdm","link_id":"t3_2qyouj","author_flair_css_class":"0087","gilded":0,"author_flair_text":"","retrieved_on":1425124239,"ups":0,"controversiality":0,"edited":1420070926,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s599","parent_id":"t3_2qyouj","subreddit":"whowouldwin"},

Now, had my command been this:\n\n    echo $string | sed 's/,//g'\n\nThat would have substituted all commas globally in the entire string.  However, we only wanted to strip out the second one.   If we wanted to change the second comma to say a colon we could change sed to this syntax:\n\n    echo $string | sed 's/,/:/2'\n\nAlso, in sed, the froward slashes are just delimiters (lack of a better word) for the substitution going on, you can replace them with other characters like asterisks in the event you want to substitute slashes like so:\n\n    echo $string | sed 's*,**2'\n\nSo, I am assuming that CSV is some sort of inventory sheet for Dell monitors, so assuming all the data you want to edit is in the same format we can assume that the second comma is the one you want replaced.

The article from Weigel is neither schismatic nor worthless, and I called it \"a worthwhile read.\"  \n\n&gt;He is not a man of tradition at all. An understanding of his papacy will stand on its own outside of the context of dead European popes\n\nI disagree.  There is much of the Church's tradition of concern for social justice issues that Francis has incorporated into his own outlook.  There is also a great deal of the theology of John Paul II and Benedict XVI by Francis' own admission (*Evangeli Gaudium*, sections 7, 112, 123, 198, and 272 for Benedict XVI, and sections 15, 27, 32, 40, and 110 for John Paul II.  You’ll also find a reference to Pius XI in section 205, as well as John XXIII in 41 and 84.  And that’s just the direct references in just one document) .  Of course Francis is new.  So was Benedict XVI.  So was John Paul II.  So was every pontiff before all of them.  But there is no divorce between Francis and \"dead European popes.\"  On the issue of social justice, reading Francis without the context of previous papal statements on that subject will lead to an incomplete understanding of Francis.  \n\nI invite everyone to read the social justice encyclicals, then to re-read Francis’ statements, then to judge for themselves.\n\nLeo XIII, [*Rerum Novarum*](http://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html), 1891.\n\nPius XI, [*Quadragesimo Anno*](http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19310515_quadragesimo-anno.html), 1931\n\nJohn XXIII, [*Mater et Magistra*](http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-xxiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_15051961_mater.html), 1961.\n\nJohn Paul II, [*Centesimus Annus*](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_01051991_centesimus-annus_en.html), 1991.\n\nBenedict XVI, [*Caritas in Veritate*](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20090629_caritas-in-veritate_en.html), 2009.\n\nThere you go!  You can also read Francis’ [Evangelii Gaudium](http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html) to complete your partial survey of papal documents on social justice.

{"score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_cnascih","link_id":"t3_2qwyhq","body":"I get the feeling you've never done customer support, much less for one in a large call center environment for a faceless corporation.\n\n1.  Comcast likely outsources the support to another company or companies.  Usually companies diversify their support so that differently owned call centers are directly competing with others so they don't get complacent.  They can look at reports and say X call center is doing better than Y, let's give a higher percent of the call volume to X.  How well a call center does as a whole directly impacts job security.  So to say comcast hired the person, it might be true if comcast is the one doing the support, but I'd be pretty skeptical that they do.  Generally, if comcast is outsourcing, they aren't equipped to deal with some random employee of a company they outsource work to in an individual basis.  You don't see the outliers when all the data has been averaged.\n\n2.  Customers call in wanting free stuff all the time.  I mean all the fucking time.  They will have all sorts of creative stories that may or may not be true, claiming previous agents told them they'd get free this or that, usually things that cannot ever be promised.  And even if the customer is telling the truth that an agent told them that, the agent will carefully omit that from their case notes to bring less attention to themselves should the customer call back.  The only way they'd get caught is if the call was randomly picked to get reviewed.  The 2nd agent is only going to have the customer's word vs. the previous agent's notes, which may not confirm what the customer is claiming is accurate.  Now in this case, he has it recorded, but does that truly prove to her that he didn't have a friend record it with him?  At any rate, if she isn't supposed to do it, it's not worth risking her job over satisfying one customer.  In her mind, do you think she cares more about his $12 a month than her own job security?  Absolutely not.\n\n3.  She many not even be capable of offering what he's claiming.  I've had to deal with people who were promised things we cannot do and I couldn't fulfill them either.  And that's not a case of \"well get your supervisor to do it.\"  I was the supervisor.  The next level above me was escalated cases and there was a specific guideline for what gets escalated.  A customer supposedly being promised something we literally cannot do was not a valid escalation scenario.  Before you say \"well escalate it anyway and let them handle it\" it doesn't work like that.  Knowingly escalating an invalid case too often gives more back-end work to the team that handles those, which end up de-escalated anyway as invalid.  They don't even get to see the case as the team that approves it would flag it.  Too many invalid escalations can result in a corrective action form (getting written up).  Getting 2 CAFs in 6 months would lead to the agent being terminated.\n\n4.  Within the context of the company I worked for, giving something away for free was called empowerment.  It was doing something outside the normal policy to keep the customer happy and we had limited scope of what we could use it for.  This generally required approval (as a supervisor I didn't need external approval) and was tracked as a percentage of how many calls where you gave away empowerment.  The goal was to not exceed 3% per month and anything over 5% would get investigated into.  So if I legitimately had 20 calls where 2 people had a valid reason for receiving compensation from us for an issue that is on our end, it would've been in my best interest to only give it to 1, and in most cases that tends to be the first person not the second one.\n\n5. Playing back the previous recording was likely a bad choice on his part.  That will flag the new agent that he's likely recording her call as well, and she's going to do everything by the books.  She can't get in trouble for denying him the 12 month promotion if that's what her documents/policies tell her to do.\n\nYou try to boil it down to \"well comcast is obligated to follow through with it\" but it's never that simple.  The more likely outcome is the agent that handled the first call will get written up or fired.  And now that it's gone viral to a degree, comcast may try to make it right.  For the average customer though, their call isn't going to go viral, and there are too many degrees of separation to get approval to make it right (or you have no proof the customer is telling the truth, so you err on the side of caution by denying them).  There are just so many factors at play here that someone who hasn't done customer support will be completely oblivious to.","created_utc":"1420070625","downs":0,"score":1,"author":"Gobizku","id":"cnascih","distinguished":null,"archived":false,"parent_id":"t1_cnaedg1","subreddit":"technology","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1425124237,"ups":1,"controversiality":0,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh16"},

{"downs":0,"created_utc":"1420070638","body":"I can tell you have spent a lot of effort working to persuade me. Know that I appreciate your efforts.\n\n&gt;You didn't ask for that. You asked for \"more evidence and rhetoric\" not a source for present evidence. You don't get to change the rules of debate as you go along. You also fail to address the crux of my argument, which is your complete disregard for basic economics principles like ceteris paribus and the law of demand.\n\nWhen I asked for more evidence and rhetoric, I was indeed asking for present evidence. Some sort of scientific study or article along with some more persuasive commentary possibly would have changed my mind about the issue.\n\n&gt;Can you give me a source that Japanese people follow formal legality more than they follow the law of demand?\n\nCertainly, there is a huge demand for electronics in Japan as Japan has the largest electronics industry in the world. Though this demand is present, looting and theft are practically nonexistent. During the Fukushima tsunami crisis, looting was not even on the radar. Contrast this with Europe and America where looting is always going to be a problem.\n\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2011/03/stop_thief_thank_you.html\n\n&gt;I don't follow your rhetoric that somehow Asian countries are all the same and frankly I find it racist.\n\nI wouldn't suggest that all Asian countries are the same, however I believe it is negligent to suggest that they are too different to compare. Japan and China share a lot of cultural heritage.\n\n&gt;No. The state is a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence formed through concentration of armed force in the body of the sovereign for the express purpose of relieving humanity of its purportedly unselfmanaging nature. The formation of sovereign bodies has hitherto been performed through hierarchical striation along the boundaries of class dictatorships. States serve the good of those bodies that constitute the formative kingmaker class of society that can constitute itself as dictator. They do not serve everyone. This is evidenced in a myriad of ways, but since we're arguing on the internet, I figure I might as well drop the classic example of the Holocaust, wherein the state was willing to serve the general welfare of all people only inasmuch as 11+ millions of people were considered to be not people.\n\nThe state most certainly does not have a monopoly on force. In democratic countries, the sovereign of the state is the people. If the people think they are ill-governed, the people can change the government. If the government will not change then revolution is the only recourse. Many governments have been overturned through violent revolutions. Recent studies have even suggested that all it takes is 3.5% of a population to overturn a government.\n\nhttp://rationalinsurgent.com/2013/11/04/my-talk-at-tedxboulder-civil-resistance-and-the-3-5-rule/\n\n&gt;Wrong. It is not in the interest of women seeking abortions. Inasmuch as the state has a duty to prevent underpopulation, it is not best resolved by abortion. Further, there is no evidence that this will affect billions of people.\n\nIt would be in the long term interest of women seeking abortions. I am now persuaded that it would not be best resolved by prohibition, however there is good evidence that a lack of laborers will lead to an economic recession or depression, and such a depression will definitely effect billions as Japan is the third largest economy in the world.\n\n&gt;Cereal is sold at grocery stores. Milk is sold at grocery stores, too. Grocery stores employ workers. Let's say we have ten workers who work at a grocery store that exclusively sells cereal and milk. Let's also say that this grocery store is a monopoly and therefore its sales are representative of aggregate demand for both milk and cereal in the economy where it resides. All ten of these workers handle both cereal and milk in their occupational duties. If the store were to stop selling cereal because of a government decree that cereal is causing a dangerously negative birth rate, but were to continue selling milk, the store would still be representative of the aggregate demand for milk. The workers, formerly charged with sale of both milk and cereal, now will be charged solely with the sale of milk. However, this store represents the aggregate demand. They can try to substitute milk for cereal to some extent by diverting productive resources for the sale of cereal to the sale of milk, but this effectively will serve the purpose of shifting the price of milk downwards along the demand curve while not substantially recovering the sales normally allocated to cereal. The marginal rate of substitution for milk and cereal, you see, is not perfect. To some extent, substitution falls flat. So, even though the store still sells milk, and its workers are perfectly trained and capable of selling milk, approximately half of the workers will be laid off. Abortion is cereal. Other procedures are milk. It might not be half, but to disregard potential economic effects on the basis that health care professionals have more than one function is irresponsible\n\nI suppose it would be negligent to disregard potential economic effects of outlawing abortion. However I'm not convinced that the economic ramifications would outweigh the benefits of adding another 200,000 - 300,000 people into the economy.\n\n&gt;Women make up (more than) half the labor force and spend their wages as (more than) half of the consumer base. There is the potential for the economy to be cut in half in a few short years.\n\nI'm afraid I'm not convinced that out of 60 million women, a couple hundred thousand of them putting their careers on hold would cut the economy in half.\n\n&gt;Who are you to purpose your thought as law of nature? I'll again ask why should I care what you think? I don't see any conceivable reason in the absence of all evidence, that I am making an overestimation. From this section of the response, you also ignore the potential impacts of women made infertile, dead, or prisoner by proposed measures for criminalization of abortion.\n\nI believe you are the one who is trying to persuade me. If you don't care what I think then why are you putting so much effort into persuasion?\n\n&gt;This is self-contradicting. It either works, doesn't work, or is inconclusive. These classifications don't overlap. What's more, if a criminalization of abortion were put into effect, the same claim could be used to unilaterally dismiss it. You lack a metric by which to evaluate the efficacy of methods but insist on the superiority of your own proposition on grounds of blind faith.\n\nI believe that this trichotomy is really a spectrum of certainty. A point has a level of certainty which changes continuously with new information arriving. \n\n&gt;I'll top this off with one new argument to keep things fresh: immigration policy reform stands a far greater chance at increasing the Japanese population than criminalized abortion.\n\nI'm afraid I have already awarded a delta for this good point.\n\nps: you really ought to take a course on Aristotelian rhetoric. The way you debate is quite combative and is not conducive to persuading anyone. Persuasion is really an art which comprises compelling points, interesting illustrations, inspiring dialogue, and friendly prodding among other things.","archived":false,"id":"cnascq1","distinguished":null,"author":"LogicRulesOverAll","score":0,"score_hidden":false,"link_id":"t3_2qwnfj","name":"t1_cnascq1","retrieved_on":1425124234,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":"1∆","gilded":0,"author_flair_css_class":" points","subreddit_id":"t5_2w2s8","edited":false,"controversiality":0,"subreddit":"changemyview","parent_id":"t1_cnaad40"},

In 17 years as a professional developer--since 1999 on Java--I have never seen a professional organization release any view technology that was not, ultimately, based on JSP. Surely, it's technically possible to deploy something only on a Velocity front end but it's simply not done.\n\nYou've *never* seen a Java web application that *doesn't* use JSP?  I'll accept that, I've interviewed developers that have *never* used a debugger.  However your assertion that it is \"simply not done\" is flat out wrong.  Many projects do not use JSP at all and furthermore how often JSP is used isn't even relevant.  You asserted JSP is the *foundation* of *all* view technologies and it simply isn't the foundation of *any* of those view technologies.\n\n&gt; Spring MVC--which I have deep and extensive experience with--is a Swiss army knife that can be used with many other technologies--but 99% of its uses include JSP.\n\nIf you're going to use hyperbole why don't you go all the way and claim JSP is used 100% of the time?  Heck, you already did when you claimed there aren't any Java web applications that don't use JSP in the first place.  Would you care to substantiate this rather bold assertion? \n\nAround here the mere suggestion that we should use JSP would likely get a rather interesting response.\n\n&gt; So, it appears you're just trying to speak in asterisks and edge cases for the dubious point of finding exceptions to the obvious rules that I stated clearly. Every one of your \"exceptions\" the the general rules I laid out are microsopic edge cases that are never used professionally.\n\nSo you are asserting that:\n\n1. Thymeleaf is *never* used professionally.\n2. Velocity is *never* used professionally.\n3. Freemarker is *never* used professionally.\n4. Other non-HTML based rendering (e.g. XML, JSON, YAML) using libraries such as JAXB or Jackson (both of which Spring MVC supports out of the box) are *never* used professionally.\n\nSeriously?\n\n&gt; Surely, it's possible to write a Spring MVC app that writes full HTML instead of using JSP but can you suggest one professional application that does this, when the full suite of JSP-dependent technologies are right there?\n\nTo begin with I never once mentioned rendering HTML in the first place, so I'm not sure why you're attached to it.  Are you under the impression that Spring MVC only supports rendering HTML?  Perhaps you're going to claim it can but *nobody* does that either.\n\nLast but not least, I must re-iterate, not a single one of the technologies I listed are *dependent* on JSP and not a single one of them has JSP as their *foundation*.\n\nP.S. You may want to inform the Spring team that 9 of the 10 view technologies they support out of the box are \"never used professionally\" so as to save them the work of supporting them.","archived":false,"id":"cnascud","distinguished":null,"score":1,"author":"thekab"},
